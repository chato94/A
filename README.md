# A [Server]
This is a simple static file server powered by Node.js

# Main Description
It is the refactored^2 version of A Server 3.1, which was coded using Dropbox
and a lot of patience. Hopefully, this server will simply be a plug and play
server like WAMP, meaning that it will serve a web page by simply typing in
the path to the file relative to the path of the index.js file, then sending
all dependencies for the page correctly, and serving a 404 page for a non-
existing page, directory, or file of any kind (only limited by MIME types). 

# Future Development
Hopefully with more development, it will reach the point where it will have
easy dynamic page serving support, similar to JsCon's universal support of any
JavaScript function, all with the hopes of being a great tool to use to host
pages for any purpose necessary on a home network as an intranet.
