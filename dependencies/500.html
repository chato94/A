			There was an internal server error. Rest assured that the monkeys are most 
			likely working on it, and then try again later. If you keep seeing this message, 
			make sure to contact your local developer and tell him that the machine blew 
			up again. He (or she) will know exactly what that means, and hopefully the page 
			that you loaded will be in tip-top shape before you know it.

			Do especially let the developers know if you get this message, and then the page 
			fails to connect entirely (but your Internet is still working perfectly fine). This  
			means that the server crashed, and unless it is manually restarted from the same 
			machine, it won't work anymore. Thank you for your patience, and for reading this 
			message of course :)
